# Text compare component for Delphi and Free Pascal

Source code for the freeware component TDiff is written in Delphi. This 
component dramatically simplify programming tasks that require calculations
of 'shortest path' or 'longest common sequence' as typically required in file 
compare utilities.

TDiff is used in RJ TextEd to compare text or source files. You need to add
the units "DiffTypes" and "Diff" to the uses section of your application.

The units "Diff_NP" and "Diff_ND" contains the available algorithms that can
be used from the TDiff class.  

PDF documents fully describing the principle algorithms used in Diff_NP and Diff_ND...\
The algorithm in the Diff_ND unit is based on: 
"An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations" by E Myers - 
Algorithmica Vol. 1 No. 2, 1986, pp. 251-266\
The algorithm in the Diff_NP unit is based on: "An O(NP) Sequence Comparison Algorithm"
by Sun Wu, Udi Manber & Gene Myers

### Getting Started

Download the files and include the units DiffTypes and Diff in your project.

### Demo applications

Two very simple demo applications (with full source code) are include to
demonstrate how the 'TDiff' component can be used in Delphi and Lazarus programs.

### Version history
- **December 2001**\
  Original release (used Myer O(ND) Difference Algorithm) 
- **22 April 2008**\
  Complete rewrite to greatly improve the code and provide a much simpler view of differences through a new 'Compares' property.
- **21 May 2008**\
  Another complete code rewrite to use Sun Wu et al. O(NP) Sequence Comparison Algorithm which more than halves times of typical comparisons.
- **24 May 2008**\
  Reimplemented "divide-and-conquer" technique (which was omitted in 21 May release) so memory use is again minimal.
- **25 May 2008**\
  Removed recursion to avoid the possibility of running out of stack memory during massive comparisons.
- **2 June 2008**\
  Minor bugfixes.
- **11 November 2018**\
  Added TList<Cardinal> to store hash values.\
  Made some minor code formatting and code changes\
  Fixed Unicode string issues
- **19 May 2020**\
  Added Lazarus support
- **23 May 2020**\
  Replaced almost all code in demo 1. It should be much easier to understand now.\
  Fixed a few issues in demo 2.
- **13 July 2023**\
  Rewrote the component and made it easy to select the algorithm to use for comparison.\
  Fixed several issues and updated the demos.
- **16 April 2025**\
  Fixed an issue in Diff_ND when comparing strings.
